# Racelink
Racelink is a React web app for exploring real-time and historical F1 data via the OpenF1 API. It offers race results, driver/team profiles, lap-time charts, and session info. A smart search maps common names to API IDs, while a responsive UI and reusable components highlight API integration and data visualization.
